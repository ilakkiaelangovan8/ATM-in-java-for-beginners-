# ATM-in-java-for-beginners-
Here I am done basic ATM program for java beginners so that they can easily understand the switch concept
In 1st step I done a user and password for the login
Here I gave a in-built login for beginners like admin
if it was matched then it will open the ATM where we can deposit, withdraw and check balance for the user and then we can exit from the loop
Thank you!!!
